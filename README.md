# Connections Game
A web-based interactive game inspired by the New York Times Connections. This game allows users to shuffle, sort, and reset boxes in a grid while maintaining color and state properties. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Load in data from NYT connections
- Shuffle Boxes: Randomly shuffles the boxes in the grid.
Sort Boxes: Sorts boxes by color and fills the remaining spaces with white boxes.
- Clear Board: Resets the board by clearing all guesses and setting the boxes back to their default white state.
- Drag and Drop: Allows users to drag and drop boxes to reorder them within the grid.
- Box States: Each box has two states - guess and confirmed. The color and opacity of the box change depending on the state.
